                <p><strong>MasterWP will take your WordPress skills to the next level.</strong> You'll be elevated from user to power user – with the skills to produce customized, fast and secure WordPress sites.</p>

                <p>Most WordPress training courses, tutorials and info from theme shops focus on the basics: how to add pages, how to install themes. If you want to do anything more complicated they say "hire a developer".</p>

                <p>This is fine, but what about users who want to do everything a developer can do?</p>

                <p><strong>This course bridges the gap between users and developers</strong>.</p>
